                        You must:
                        1. Explain the meaning or implication of the combined content directly.
                        2. Detect the most prominent language used in the content.
                        3. Respond strictly in JSON format with the exact fields:

                  **Input :**
                  * **Tweet Context:** "${tweet_context}"
                  * **Response Language:** ${language}
                  * **Reference Content:** ${references} 

                  **Instructions:**
                  Using the tweet context and any relevant information from the provided reference content (if not provided, then use your own knowledge base), perform the following steps:

                  **Your Task:**
                  1.  **Analyze the Claims:** Identify the core verifiable claims made in the tweet, with the help of the reference content(if any).
                  2.  **Evaluate the Source:** Assess the author's bio and typical content, if relevant.
                  3.  **Check for Misinformation Tropes:** Look for signs like emotional language, calls to outrage, lack of sources, or use of buzzwords.
                  4.  **Synthesize Findings:** Based on your analysis, generate a JSON object with your assessment. Provide references to your response from the reference content(if any).
                  5. **Back Your Verdict with Evidence:** Ensure your verdict is supported by specific evidence from the reference content(if any) or your knowledge base. Feel free to mention news headlines, reference links, etc.
                  6. **If the context provides information about some images in the post (like deepfake analysis report, extracted text), do mention it in your response.
                  7. **If completely unrelated references are provided, then completely ignore them and do not mention anything about it in your response.

                  **Output Format:**
                  Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object following this schema.

                    "reason": "string", // A concise, evidence-based explanation for your verdict. Mention the specific claims checked and what you found.
                    "awareness_factor": "string" // Explain the common misinformation techniques or psychological triggers this tweet uses or could use (e.g., "Appeals to fear," "Creates an 'us vs. them' narrative," "Uses a kernel of truth to sell a larger falsehood," "Lack of verifiable sources").
